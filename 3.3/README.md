Task 3.3 “Software Development Lifecycle” of CyberSec4Europe had as one of its main goals to identify research challenges, requirements and approaches in all stages of the lifecycle of software. 

# Research Challenges in Secure Software Lifecycle

One of the main outcomes was the following set of research challenges related to security and privacy issues in the lifecycle of software:

1. Assessing Security and Privacy Through the Life Cycle Short-term research
2. Assessing Privacy Properties of Complex Systems Short-term research
3. Privacy protection and User Empowerment in IoT Short-term research
4. Securing Unsafe and Legacy Software Short-term research
5. Protecting Leaked Credentials Short-term research
6. Secure Access Control in Heterogeneous Systems Short-term research
7. Manageable and Understandable Security Engineering Short-term research
8. Unreliable Risk Estimates Short-term research
9. Automated and Verified Network Security Configuration in Highly Dynamic Environments
10. Scalable and Private Industrial Blockchain Short-term research
11. Scaling TEEs for Cloud Applications Short-term research

The challenges are described in detail in the document [D3.9 Research challenges and requirements for secure software development](https://cybersec4europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CS4E-D3.9-Research-challenges-and-requirements-for-secure-software-development-v1.1-Submitted.pdf).

# Proactive approaches for secure software development

The analysis of the research challenges lead to the identification of promising tool-supported approaches to be developed in order to address the challenges. A total of 13 tools to support different activities in the lifecycle of software was developed and demonstrated on a common smart-cities scenario as illustrated in the figure below.
